# Woobu-Autonomous-Drone
Woobu Autonomous Drone is a work in progress flying machine project. The goals are for this flying machine to autonomously fly itself, autonomously hover, autonomously balance itself, and autonomously lands itself. This project uses Raspberry Pi Pico plus MPU6050 as main hardware.
