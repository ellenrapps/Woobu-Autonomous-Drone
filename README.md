Woobu Autonomous Drone  

Woobu Autonomous Drone is a flying machine project. The code is completed. The code allows a flying machine to autonomously fly itself, autonomously hover, autonomously balance itself, and autonomously land itself.  

This project uses Raspberry Pi Pico W plus MPU6050 as the main hardware, and (Micro)Python, HTML and Javascript as the main programming languages.

As shown in my videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECWFBZKwFYE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ19gocz3pc), the current setups have hardware issues. Despite this limitation, the completed code published on my GitHub page is working and
can be used in your own drone hardware setup. 

The code can read X and Y angles faster than a blink of an eye and display these X, Y angles on your mobile browser. On your mobile browser, you can control the following drone movements: Auto Takeoff, Hover, Down, On, and Off. 

The following are the future milestones for Woobu Autonomous Drone:
1) MPU6050's gyroscope and accelerometer shall be used to measure altitude and distance indoor and outdoor
2) MPU6050 shall not only be used in autonomous drone setups but also in other flying machine setups
